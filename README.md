# Exoplanet Host Star Analysis

A detailed data science project exploring how host star characteristics - specifically mass and temperature - influence the number and types of exoplanets they host. Using real-world astronomical datasets from NASA, this project involves cleaning, analyzing, and modeling exoplanet data to uncover patterns and relationships.

### Research Question

How do host star mass and temperature influence the number and types of exoplanets in their systems?

Motivation

Understanding these relationships is crucial for astrophysics and exoplanetary science. This analysis can help predict which stars are most likely to host certain types or numbers of planets, guiding future observations and studies.
