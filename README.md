# Exoplanet Host Star Analysis

A detailed data science project exploring how host star characteristics - specifically mass and temperature - influence the number and types of exoplanets they host. Using real-world astronomical datasets from NASA, this project involves cleaning, analyzing, and modeling exoplanet data to uncover patterns and relationships.

## Research Question

How do host star mass and temperature influence the number and types of exoplanets in their systems?

## Motivation

Understanding these relationships is crucial for **astrophysics and exoplanetary science.** This analysis can help predict which stars are most likely to host certain types or numbers of planets, guiding future observations and studies.

## Data Source
	•	Dataset: NASA Exoplanet Archive - Confirmed Planets Table
